Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

Enum - Enum is an user defined data type in SQL, which helps to restrict the values a column can have.
In this example, the column low_fats and recyclable columns can have a possiblity of 'Y' or 'N' in it and nothing else.

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.
Arrange the output in the ascending order of product_id
